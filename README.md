## Introduction
:warning:**This is a WIP proof of concept, not a fully developed game.**

This game is a proof of concept for a roguelike using chess mechanics, made with Lua and Love2d.

It was initially made for a two-week-long game jam on January of 2020, but not finished on time.

Most of the initial incentive behind it was to learn Love2d/Lua in practice.
